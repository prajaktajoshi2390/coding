Question 1
As a child runs up the stairs, they can hop up 1, 2, or 3 steps at a time. Write a function that counts the number of possible ways a child can run up a staircase with N steps.

For example:
Given a staircase with 4 steps, the child can run up the staircase in following 7 ways (combination of steps)

1,1,1,1
1,1,2
1,3
3,1
2,1,1
2,2 and 
1,2,1
So countWays(4) = 7

---------+---------
{{init}} | 0
     [1] | 1
     [2] | 12
     [+] | 12
     [3] | 3
